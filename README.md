# Customer Churn Prediction for Financial Services Sector
Telco Customer Churn dataset aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company. It includes customer demographics, account details, services, and churn status. The goal: build a model to forecast churn accurately, aiding the company in proactive retention strategies.

# Key Achievements:
I spearheaded the development of a predictive model aimed at identifying potential customer churn within the financial services sector. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, I meticulously analyzed historical customer data to uncover patterns indicative of churn behavior.

Utilizing Python with pandas for data preprocessing and scikit-learn for model development, I engineered features and fine-tuned model parameters to optimize predictive performance. Through rigorous testing and validation, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of 76.55%, empowering the organization to implement proactive customer retention strategies.
