## 🌐 Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle ([Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer))  
- **Description**: Contains customer demographics, service details, and churn labels  
- **Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and normalized numerical data  

---

## 📝 Project Overview
This project builds a predictive model to **detect customer churn** in the telecom sector. By utilizing **data preprocessing, imbalance handling, and robust classifiers**, it provides actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔹 1. Data Preprocessing
- Addressed missing values and inconsistent entries  
- Converted categorical features using **one-hot encoding**  
- Scaled numerical variables to optimize model performance  

### 🔹 2. Imbalanced Data Handling
- Applied **SMOTEENN (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling and Edited Nearest Neighbors)** to balance the dataset  
- Improved recall for churned customers while maintaining overall model stability  

### 🔹 3. Model Training & Evaluation
- Implemented **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers  
- Assessed model performance using:
  - **Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix**
- **Achieved 92.36% accuracy** with the Random Forest model  

### 🔹 4. Model Deployment
- Saved the trained model as `model.sav`  
- Ready for **API integration** to enable real-time churn prediction
