Customer Churn Prediction

Project Description:
Developed a comprehensive machine learning model to predict customer churn for a Telcom company dataset, leveraging historical client data to identify patterns and key risk factors.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered and cleaned extensive datasets, including customer demographics, transaction history, and engagement metrics.

Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features from raw data, such as customer tenure, transaction frequency, and engagement scores.

Model Development: Implemented and compared various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to identify the most accurate model.

Evaluation and Optimization: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC, and optimized the model through hyperparameter tuning.


Benefits:
------------------
Enhanced customer retention through proactive identification of potential churners.

Improved resource allocation by focusing efforts on high-risk customers.

Strengthened customer relationships and loyalty, contributing to long-term business growth.

Model development using scikit-learn.

Achieved an accuracy of 76.55% for proactive customer retention strategies.
