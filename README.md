Customer Churn Prediction Model for Telecom Sector

Dataset Link: The dataset can be found on Kaggle â€“ https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer

Project Overview: Developed a sophisticated machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. Leveraged advanced data handling techniques and classifiers to ensure high prediction accuracy.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw data, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables.

Imbalanced Data Handling: Applied SMOTEENN (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and Edited Nearest Neighbors) to balance the dataset, ensuring better model performance on minority classes.

Model Training and Evaluation:

Implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers.

Evaluated models using precision, recall, f1-score, and confusion matrix.

Achieved an accuracy of 92.36% with the Random Forest classifier, with high precision and recall for the minority class.

Model Deployment: Saved the trained model as model.sav for easy deployment through APIs, enabling real-time churn prediction.
Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn

Techniques: SMOTEENN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Data Preprocessing

Impact:

Accuracy Improvement: Enhanced model accuracy and reliability, particularly for predicting churned customers.

Business Value: Enabled the telecom company to proactively address customer churn, improving retention strategies and overall revenue.
